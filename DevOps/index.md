# DevOps Notes
## Introduction to DevOps
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The main goal is to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

<!-- 9 phases of Devops -->
## Phases of DevOps
1. **Planning**: Define the project scope, requirements, and objectives.
2. **Development**: Write and build the code.
3. **Testing**: Validate the code through automated and manual testing.
4. **Deployment**: Release the code to production environments.
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the application and infrastructure for performance and issues.
6. **Feedback**: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to improve the product.
7. **Operations**: Manage the infrastructure and ensure system reliability.
8. **Security**: Integrate security practices throughout the DevOps lifecycle (DevSecOps).
9. **Collaboration**: Foster a culture of collaboration between teams to enhance communication and efficiency.

## Key Concepts
- **Collaboration**: DevOps emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and reduce errors.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Merging code changes frequently to detect issues early.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Ensuring that code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using code and automation tools.
## Tools and Technologies
- **Version Control Systems**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
